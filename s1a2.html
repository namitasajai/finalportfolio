                In a collaborative classroom project, our class embarked on building an assemblage sculpture utilizing found and classroom materials. Following this, each individual student was tasked with creating a "CSS Still Life" that incorporated HTML layout, nesting, and CSS styling. The final artworks had the freedom to explore CSS animations and varying degrees of design reduction and abstraction. All HTML and CSS drawings were required to be horizontally oriented with dimensions of 800x600px. For my part, I approached the assignment with a realist perspective, aiming to recreate the original photograph as faithfully as possible. Additionally, I infused my own creative touch by incorporating unique animations to various objects within the composition, resulting in an engaging and interactive webpage experience for users.
