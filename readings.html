                The author of the work, Ulisses Carrión, suggests in his writing that by breaking the traditions or normal conventions of a book, artists can create a form of “new art” that outshines what we normally define as books. While he presents several seemingly outlandish arguments, such as the proposal that a blank book is the best book, he does bring up points that I can see being useful especially in digital art. In breaking stereotypes and conventional uses of digital spaces, we can communicate powerful messages.

                This week's reading was very insightful and had a much more direct connection to class material than the previous week's. The metaphor's that the author of the first essay mentioned about different approaches to website designing (the website as a room) reminded me of different creative websites I've seen before (especially from the SOTD on awwwards.com) and the exhibition we discussed in class in which the artist instructed the gallery to draw a single line connecting the walls. Laurel Schwulst uses these ideas and approaches to push her readers into thinking outside the commercialized spaces that web design has primarily become a part of. As an aspiring web designer myself, I thought her vision and input into the web design space were very encouraging.

                Alessandro Ludovico and Florian Cramer's take on Post-Digital-Print offers a unique perspective on the evolution of media into the digital age. The authors pointed out several creative uses for "hybrid" print media such as the potential of QR codes or Martin Fuchs and Peter Bichsel’s book Written Images which I found particularly interesting. In the future, web designers may begin to integrate print by introducing books that follow along with the webpage or involve illustrations that pair with it. Alternatively, if technology allows, perhaps a projector of some sort that overlays content on top of a book could be a cool hybrid print media. However, I do think the authors fail to recognize the ease of use that "digital-only" content allows for that many users look for/prefer to print.

                Ben Duvall's <i>Selections from New Modernism</i> introduced the concept of signs and hyperlinked signs to me. I especially enjoyed reading the section on hyperlinked signs. When Duvall explains the history of Mickey Mouse, he mentions the use of Mickey's body parts as cultural props and/or symbols of larger themes. It was crazy to think Mickey's ear's might have been references to the entertainment industry or another symbol. This way of embedding symbolism in the small details is a really cool concept that I hope to draw on in future designs.

                While reading, I found the authors discussion of the intersection of Gestalt psychology and optical illusions to be really fascinating especially after taking an AP Psych class back in high school that broke down the same phenomenons through biology. It was cool to see how various forms could be explained through Gestalt principles. I thought the authors breakdown of the cover of The Primer for Visual Literacy, for instance, was pretty eye-opening after not paying much attention to it the first time actually reading excerpts from it. I also thought it was almost scary to see how well AT&T had predicted future technology in their advertising.

                I found this text to be incredibly eye opening. First of all, I appreciate the personality in the audiobook recording. It made listening to the selection a lot more entertaining and enjoyable. The authors of the text push for a less objective style of alt text and instead a more meaningful, poetic style that relies more on imagery to convey the original author’s message. Hearing this from disabled artists themselves made it all the more impactful and something I will gladly attempt to incorporate into my work.

                This was a really interesting read. I thought the author providing his take on watches and luxury products/credit cards was especially thought-provoking. The author states that authentic Louis Vuitton bags are only given value from their counterpart fake bags constructed away from the white market. Watches (with the invention of the cellular phone) have now become more of less just a part of fashion. The way in which value is attached to surface and how this value can adapt and change over time is really cool.

                This reading was again incredibly informative and eye opening to the various biases that are engrained in not only our computer software but programming languages and such. I had never thought to consider how English is necessary to learning how to code. Nasser’s final thoughts on creating a “lingua franca” system seems a bit implausible but does invite a new layer of thought.

                Paul Soulellis' "Performing the Feed" was an interesting take on various social media practices. Soulellis opens up his discussion by outlining the origins of what he calls "the Post" and what it meant in the  "old age of publishing". He then pivots his discussion to "The Continuous Feed" where he talks about and breaks down what draws viewers' attention to Twitch and other live-streaming platforms. He concludes that this motivation to watch stems from the "new boredom." Paul states that we are being driven by our need to watch, judge, and witness the scene at hand. As a former Twitch viewer myself, I've come to different conclusions. I have noticed several streamers develop what they consider "para-social" relationships with their viewers- -relationships that mimic friendship across the screen- that some may even consider harmful. These false friendships push their generally younger audience to stick by them and continue participating in their stream. Paul Soulellis continues forth to acknowledge how feeds have become limitless or never-ending.             </div>

                Programming is innately feminine according to Wendy Hui Kyong Chun. I found this incredibly ironic when the tech world is now dominated by male programmers who often subconsciously look down upon women in the field. Wendy’s points throughout the text that software is all but an illusion or an ideology put in place by greater factions. I think this is an incredibly divisive take that may or may not be true. I think there are still light hearted spaces in software that don’t necessarily abide to this logic.
