                In the API project, we explored the functionality of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their role in securely sharing restricted data between different applications, tools, or services. Our goal was to leverage this "public facing" data to develop an interactive design tool that seamlessly connected with IFTTT (If This Then That) service. Working collaboratively in a team of four, we successfully created an IFTTT applet that notified users whenever the International Space Station passed overhead. To complement this innovative tool, we designed and developed a sleek and minimal promotional webpage. The webpage featured links to a Figma mockup, showcasing the user interface and experience of our design tool, as well as the actual IFTTT applet itself. Through this project, we demonstrated our ability to utilize APIs effectively, implement practical real-life applications, and promote our solution through an intuitive and informative website.
